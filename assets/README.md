# Assets Folder

This folder contains game assets.

## Required Files

- **mine.gif** - Animated GIF image for mine indicator (recommended size: 28x28 pixels)

Place your `mine.gif` file in this directory. The game will automatically use it to display mines when they are revealed.

If the GIF file is not found, the game will fall back to using an emoji (💣) as the mine indicator.
